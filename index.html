		<p>GEDKeeper program is developed for work with personal genealogical database.</p>

		<p>The program is designed for extremely simple and intuitive interface. The program is very easy to install on the computer, 
		fully supports the GEDCOM format, has no restrictions on the number of persons and generations, allows you to generate pedigrees, 
		building several tree species, as well as print and save their images, provides fast navigation, filtering, searching and adding multimedia materials. 
		In addition there is an output of geographic data on Google maps (© Google).</p>

		<p>The aim of the program is as quick and effective means of conducting personal genealogical database.</p>
